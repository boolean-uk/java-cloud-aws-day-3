## Deploy Backend Using AWS Lambda and API Gateway
### Steps
1. Create a Lambda Function:
   - Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to Lambda.
   - Click Create function.
   - Choose Author from scratch.
   - Name the function (e.g., MyBackendFunction).
   - Select the JAVA runtime.
   - Click Create function.

2. Add Function Logic:
   - Add a simple backend function to respond to API requests:
   ```JAVA
   
   ```

3. Set Up API Gateway:

   - Navigate to API Gateway in AWS Console.
   - Click Create API.
   - Choose HTTP API and click Build.
   - Name your API (e.g., MyBackendAPI).
   - Under Integrations, select Lambda and choose your Lambda function.
   - Click Next and deploy your API.

4. Test the API:

   - Open a browser and visit the URL generated by API Gateway (`https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/register`).
   - Verify that it returns the message: `"Hello, /register"`.

# Core Activity

Rather than re-invent the wheel we're going to make use of some of AWS' own documentation to introduce the Serverless Java Container as a way of using Spring with AWS Lambda and API Gateway to create a serverless API environment.

- Main Repo for Serverless is [here](https://github.com/aws/serverless-java-container)

- The Quick Start Guide for deploying a Spring 3 App with a Serverless Container is [here](https://github.com/aws/serverless-java-container/wiki/Quick-start---Spring-Boot3)

- The Sample Application can be found [here](https://github.com/aws/serverless-java-container/tree/main/samples/springboot3/pet-store)

- Take some time this morning, to rework either the Todo App or a Spring App of your own in order to deploy it via AWS Lambda and the API Gateway as documented in these.


## Use Terraform to Automate Lambda Deployment
## Prerequisites:
   -[] Ensure that Terraform CLI is installed and AWS CLI is configured.
### Steps
1. Write Terraform Configuration:
    - In your project folder, create a file named main.tf with the following content:
    ```bash
      provider "aws" {
         region = "eu-north-1"
      }

      resource "aws_iam_role" "lambda_role" {
         name = "lambda_role"
         assume_role_policy = jsonencode({
            Version = "2012-10-17",
            Statement = [{
               Action = "sts:AssumeRole",
               Effect = "Allow",
               Principal = {
               Service = "lambda.amazonaws.com"
               }
            }]
         })
      }

      resource "aws_lambda_function" "backend" {
         filename         = "backend.zip"
         function_name    = "MyBackendFunction"
         role             = aws_iam_role.lambda_role.arn
         handler          = "Backend::Backend.Function::FunctionHandler"
         runtime          = "java" -- JAVAENVIRONMENT
         source_code_hash = filebase64sha256("backend.zip")
      }

      resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "api" {
         name = "MyBackendAPI"
      }

      resource "aws_api_gateway_resource" "resource" {
         rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api.id
         parent_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api.root_resource_id
         path_part   = "register"
      }

      resource "aws_api_gateway_method" "method" {
         rest_api_id   = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api.id
         resource_id   = aws_api_gateway_resource.resource.id
         http_method   = "GET"
         authorization = "NONE"
      }

      resource "aws_api_gateway_integration" "integration" {
         rest_api_id = aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api.id
         resource_id = aws_api_gateway_resource.resource.id
         http_method = aws_api_gateway_method.method.http_method
         type        = "AWS_PROXY"
         integration_http_method = "POST"
         uri         = aws_lambda_function.backend.invoke_arn
      }
   ```

2. Package Your Lambda Code:
   - Publish your Lambda function using the following commands:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release -o out --JAVA COMMAND TO PUBLISH
   cd out
   zip -r backend.zip .

   ```

3. Run Terraform:
   - Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```
   - Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```
4. Verify Lambda and API Gateway Deployment:
   - Check the API Gateway endpoint URL in AWS and ensure it is connected to the Lambda function by visiting `https://your-api-id.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com/register`.

## (Optional) Split Functionalities into Multiple Lambda Functions
### Steps

1. Create Additional Lambda Functions:
   - Create separate Lambda functions to handle different tasks. For example, create one function for user registration and another for order processing.

2. Update API Gateway:
   - In API Gateway, add new routes like `/register` and `/order`, linking each route to its respective Lambda function.

3. Test the API:
   - Verify that different routes trigger different Lambda functions. For instance:
   - `/register` calls the user registration function.
   - `/order` calls the order processing function.
